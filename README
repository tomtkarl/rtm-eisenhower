Eisenhower Matrix for Remember the Milk
=======================================

This simple web page will take your RTM tasks and graph them in an [Eisenhower matrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method).

**Urgency** in the matrix corresponds to days left until the due date of the task. <br />
**Importance** corresponds to the priority (1, 2, 3, and None).

This is all done entirely client-side in Javascript.
